                <h2>&mdash;<br>Hello</h2>
                <p>I've been working as a graphic designer for over a decade. Experience working on everything from designing and developing web apps to directing video shoots has given me a generalist toolbox that's proven invaluable in my approach to branding and creative direction.</p>
                <p>In 2016, I started Radsmth as an anti-agency model with the intention to deliver agency-quality design, a deliberate focus on customer service and transparent, affordable pricing.</p>
